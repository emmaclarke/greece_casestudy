Having made a pre-election pledge of "not another cent" to the bondholders, the Taoiseach made a post-election U-turn proclaiming that he would not wear the slogan of "debt defaulter" on his forehead. It is clear that the slogan of indebtedness will be marked across our brows for many years because of the cowardice and incompetence of this Fine Gael and Labour Government.
A massive burden of odious debt â€“ the debts of bankers, speculators and developers - weighs heavily on this and future generations. All the while, the Taoiseach has busied himself currying favour with the troika and his friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.
